# Code Generation Summary - Business Youthful Color Refresh

## Outcome

The Business theme now uses the supplied `#3368A0`, `#66A3BF`, `#C8DFDB`, and `#F2EFE7` background palette together with accessible roles derived from the supplied text palette. The complete Direct Contact card composition is centered, and its email and three social links use highlighted interactive surfaces; the profile record is capped at `20rem` with a balanced `4 / 3.5` portrait frame; dark supporting text is brighter; and every decorative Business sequence number is removed. The three supplied PNG project images now replace the deleted WebP covers and display from their left edge. Business navigation rows now use consistent horizontal padding so selected text remains clear of the border. The application supports exactly Engineering and Business while preserving meaningful content, dates, years, metrics, routes, interactions, and responsive behavior.

## Modified Application Files

- `src/templates/business/business.css`
  - Replaced the dark and light root color-token declarations.
  - Used deep derived blues for dark-mode depth plus accessible gray and orange derivatives for normal-sized text.
  - Changed dark supporting text from muted taupe to near-cream `#E8E0D5`, reaching 11.49:1 contrast on the dark canvas.
  - Reduced the contact email to `clamp(0.88rem, 1.2vw, 1.1rem)` and added a centered, fit-content, max-width-constrained border box with responsive padding and safe wrapping.
  - Centered the complete contact-card content and social row so the label, email, location, and links share one visual axis.
  - Added translucent mint backgrounds, borders, padding, and stronger hover highlights to the email and each social link.
  - Capped `.business-subject-record` at `20rem`, retained `width: 100%`, and centered it within its grid area so the portrait and metadata card are visibly smaller without compromising narrow-screen fit.
  - Removed counter-only styles and collapsed desktop, tablet, and mobile grid columns formerly reserved for sequence markers.
  - Added scoped `object-position: left center` to `.business-case-image` while retaining cover behavior and frame geometry.
- `src/templates/business/BusinessShell.tsx`
  - Replaced conditional zero padding with consistent `px={3}` navigation-row padding.
  - Kept active and inactive labels aligned while providing clear space between selected text and the border.
- `src/templates/business/BusinessHero.tsx`
  - Changed the displayed portrait frame from the tall `4 / 4.4` ratio through the compact `4 / 3` correction to a balanced final `4 / 3.5` cover frame.
  - Preserved the source image, alternative text, width behavior, cover behavior, and profile metadata.
- Business presentation components
  - Removed decorative chapter/showcase/case labels, navigation counters, standalone indexes, gallery/writing/skill counters, and prefixed award/outcome codes from the hero, shell, section headings, About, Education, Experience, Awards, Projects, Gallery, Journal, Skills, and detail lists.
  - Preserved dates, years, metric values, technical quantities, content order, links, headings, semantic lists, and stable test identifiers.
- `src/data/projects.ts`
  - Replaced the three deleted WebP imports with `coursework_and_certificates.png`, `program_analyzer.png`, and `java_resume_application.png`.
  - Updated alternative text to describe the supplied course screenshot, program architecture diagram, and desktop resume-application screenshot.
- `src/templates/business/businessTemplate.test.tsx`
  - Added regression assertions that both removed label patterns stay absent.
- `src/test/data/portfolio.test.ts`
  - Requires supplied PNG project assets and screenshot-or-diagram alternative text.
- `src/themeAccessibility.test.ts`
  - Added focused palette-identity, decorative-number, complete contact-centering and highlighting, profile-size and aspect-ratio, text-readability, project-position, and navigation-padding safeguards.
  - Added regression coverage rejecting the known legacy warm Business palette.
  - Preserved the existing contrast, scope-isolation, reduced-motion, and pointer-event assertions.

## Complete Theme-Removal Amendment

- Deleted all 16 files from the retired theme's source directory, including its stylesheet and dedicated test.
- Removed its type member, registry entry, option metadata, selector icon, valid persistence ID, journal-page coverage, accessibility reads, and integration fixtures.
- Existing obsolete saved values now fail validation and fall back to Engineering.
- Deleted 79 obsolete workflow artifacts containing the retired theme reference.
- Rebuilt the active documentation index and state around the exact two-theme product boundary.
- Removed every source, path, public-documentation, and non-audit workflow-documentation occurrence.
- Preserved `aidlc-docs/audit.md` as the required append-only historical record.

No replacement or duplicate application file was created. Deleted tracked files remain recoverable from Git history.

## Palette Application

| Mode  | Foundation                                  | Text and emphasis                                                     | Interaction and depth                                      |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dark  | Derived `#10283F`, `#153652`, and `#1F4A70` | `#FCF2E5`, near-cream `#E8E0D5`, and derived `#FFA083`                | `#3368A0`, sky-blue/mint translucencies, and mint focus    |
| Light | `#F2EFE7`, `#C8DFDB`, and derived `#A8CCC9` | `#524646`, derived `#6A665C`, derived `#B83D22`, and action `#FCF2E5` | Deep-blue actions, sky-blue translucencies, and blue focus |

Semantically neutral white remains only where existing logo/media or contact-card readability requires it; it is not used as a theme-palette replacement.
