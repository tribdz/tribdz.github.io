# Code Generation Plan - Business Youthful Color Refresh

> **Status: Step 14 amendment complete; awaiting Code Generation approval.** This document is the single source of truth for the Business palette, two-theme boundary, and review refinements.

## Unit Context

- **Unit**: Business theme color system.
- **Workspace root**: `/Users/nhamhhung/nhamhung.github.io`.
- **Project type**: Brownfield React 19, TypeScript, CSS, Vite, and Vitest static application.
- **Primary responsibility**: Apply the supplied palettes to Business, preserve its layout and behavior, maintain the complete Engineering/Business theme set, and implement the approved screenshot-review refinements.
- **Application files in scope**: Business CSS, Business contact/journal/skills presentation components, template contracts/registry/options, selection persistence, selector icon mapping, maintained tests, and the complete retired-theme directory removal.
- **Documentation files in scope**: This plan, the code-generation summary, state, and append-only audit trail.
- **Other existing modifications**: Preserve all pre-existing user and workflow changes, including the current `README.md` modification.

## Requirements Traceability

No User Stories stage was needed. The unit directly implements these approved requirements:

| Plan coverage         | Requirements                                                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Palette system        | BYC-01 through BYC-05 and BYC-13                                     |
| Preservation          | BYC-06 through BYC-10                                                |
| Screenshot refinement | BYC-11, BYC-12, and BYC-14 through BYC-23                            |
| Quality               | BYC-NFR-01 through BYC-NFR-05 and all twenty-two acceptance criteria |

## Dependencies and Contracts

- Business React components consume the stylesheet's existing custom-property names and selectors; those contracts remain unchanged.
- The theme accessibility test reads hexadecimal root tokens from the Business dark and light selector blocks; required tokens remain hexadecimal.
- No database entity, API, service, route, state contract, dependency, asset, or deployment artifact changes.
- Engineering remains outside the presentation write scope.
- The visible selector and runtime registry expose Engineering and Business only.

## Planned Palette Mapping

### Source Palette

| Palette role | Exact color | Planned responsibility                                                   |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Deep blue    | `#3368A0`   | Primary light-mode accent, actions, structure, and palette anchor        |
| Sky blue     | `#66A3BF`   | Dark-mode accent, borders, glows, interactive highlights, and soft depth |
| Pale mint    | `#C8DFDB`   | Supporting surfaces, dark-mode text, and light-mode secondary foundation |
| Warm cream   | `#F2EFE7`   | Light canvas, dark-mode primary text, and calm reading surfaces          |

### Accessible Derived Values

- Use derived deep blues such as `#10283F`, `#153652`, `#1F4A70`, and `#285681` only where the four source colors cannot provide sufficient dark-mode depth, text hierarchy, hover distinction, or contrast.
- Use source-color RGB channels for translucencies so borders, controls, focus rings, overlays, and glows remain visibly related to the supplied palette.
- Keep representative pairs at or above 4.5:1: cream on deep blue is 5.04:1, sky blue on the planned dark canvas is 5.41:1, and pale mint on the planned dark canvas is 10.76:1.

## Part 2 - Implementation Steps

### Step 1 - Add Focused Palette Regression Assertions

- [x] Extend `src/themeAccessibility.test.ts` with focused Business assertions that require all four supplied source colors.
- [x] Assert that the known legacy warm Business token colors are absent from the active stylesheet.
- [x] Preserve the existing contrast, theme-isolation, pointer-event, and reduced-motion safeguards.
- [x] Run the focused test and confirm the new assertions detect the current legacy palette before the CSS update.
- **Traceability**: BYC-01, BYC-02, BYC-07, BYC-NFR-01, BYC-NFR-03; acceptance criteria 1, 2, 4, and 7.

### Step 2 - Replace the Dark Business Color System

- [x] Update only color custom properties in `.portfolio-template-business`.
- [x] Use derived deep-blue canvas and surface values with cream primary text, pale-mint supporting text, sky-blue accents, and palette-derived controls, borders, focus, overlays, and media shells.
- [x] Keep every property name, selector, layout declaration, type rule, spacing rule, responsive rule, and interaction rule unchanged.
- **Traceability**: BYC-01, BYC-02, BYC-04, BYC-05, BYC-06, BYC-NFR-01, BYC-NFR-02.

### Step 3 - Replace the Light Business Color System

- [x] Update only color custom properties in `.light .portfolio-template-business`.
- [x] Use cream and pale mint for canvas and surfaces, deep blue and accessible derived blue for text/actions, and sky-blue translucencies for supporting depth.
- [x] Keep hexadecimal critical tokens compatible with the existing contrast parser.
- **Traceability**: BYC-01, BYC-02, BYC-03, BYC-05, BYC-06, BYC-NFR-01.

### Step 4 - Remove Remaining Direct Legacy Colors

- [x] Replace any active direct warm color declaration within `business.css` that is not controlled by the root variables.
- [x] Preserve semantically neutral media/logo white only where necessary; do not treat it as part of the Business palette.
- [x] Confirm no Business selector, owned overlay, or state leaks palette styles into Engineering.
- [x] Confirm no JSX, TSX, data, route, asset, dependency, layout, or other theme file changed.
- **Traceability**: BYC-01, BYC-02, BYC-06 through BYC-08, BYC-NFR-03 through BYC-NFR-05.

### Step 5 - Verify and Format the Implementation

- [x] Run the focused Business template and theme-accessibility tests.
- [x] Run a stale-color scan for the complete known legacy Business palette.
- [x] Run Prettier on modified application and workflow files and execute `git diff --check`.
- [x] Inspect the scoped diff to confirm that only approved color and test declarations changed in application code.
- [x] Defer the complete Vitest suite, ESLint, production build, and final reproducible instructions to Build and Test after Code Generation approval.
- **Traceability**: All acceptance criteria.

### Step 6 - Record Code Generation Results

- [x] Create `aidlc-docs/construction/business-youthful-color-refresh/code/code-generation-summary.md` with modified-file, palette, contrast, isolation, and focused-test evidence.
- [x] Mark each completed plan checkbox immediately after its corresponding work finishes.
- [x] Update `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` and append the exact interaction and result to `aidlc-docs/audit.md`.
- [x] Verify that no duplicate application file was created.
- **Traceability**: Workflow documentation and all acceptance criteria.

## Rollback

Restore the prior Business root color declarations and the display-accent text reference, then remove only the focused background/text palette-identity assertions added for this change. No schema, content, dependency, build configuration, or deployment rollback is required.

### Step 7 - Apply the Approved Text Palette Review Change

- [x] Extend the focused safeguard to require `#524646`, `#A8A492`, `#FCF2E5`, and `#EC5B38` in Business text roles.
- [x] Confirm the new safeguard fails before the text-token update.
- [x] Map dark-mode primary and secondary text to cream and muted taupe, with accessible derived orange for small accent text and exact orange for display accents.
- [x] Map light-mode primary text to dark taupe, supporting text to an accessible muted-taupe derivative, accent text to an accessible dark-orange derivative, and action text to cream.
- [x] Preserve the approved blue/mint background system and every layout, component, content, interaction, and cross-theme boundary.
- [x] Run focused Business/accessibility tests, both palette scans, Prettier, scoped diff inspection, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] Update the code-generation summary, state, audit, and review gate with the amended evidence.
- **Traceability**: BYC-06 through BYC-09, BYC-NFR-01 through BYC-NFR-05, and acceptance criteria 2 through 8.

### Step 8 - Remove the Retired Theme Completely

- [x] Delete the complete retired-theme source directory and its dedicated test without creating replacements.
- [x] Reduce template IDs, registry entries, option metadata, selector icons, and persistence validation to Engineering and Business only.
- [x] Make the obsolete saved theme value invalid so existing browsers fall back to Engineering.
- [x] Remove retired-theme imports, fixtures, parameterized cases, presentation assertions, accessibility reads, and journal-page coverage from maintained tests.
- [x] Update `README.md` and active workflow documentation for the exact two-theme architecture.
- [x] Delete dedicated historical workflow artifacts and remove the retired name from every remaining non-audit documentation file.
- [x] Preserve `aidlc-docs/audit.md` unchanged except for append-only entries documenting this request and its outcome.
- [x] Run source and non-audit documentation stale-reference scans, focused tests, the complete Vitest suite, ESLint, TypeScript/Vite build, Prettier, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] Update the code-generation summary, state, audit, and review gate with deletion and verification evidence.
- **Traceability**: BYC-06 through BYC-10, BYC-NFR-03 through BYC-NFR-05, and acceptance criteria 7 through 9.

### Step 9 - Refine Contact Readability, Card Labels, and Dark Text

- [x] Add focused Business regression assertions for a bordered email treatment, absent video and certificate sequence labels, and brighter dark supporting text.
- [x] Reduce `.business-contact-email` to a smaller responsive font size; give it a fit-content, max-width-constrained border box with responsive padding and safe wrapping so the complete address remains visible.
- [x] Remove only the decorative `Film NN` label from `BusinessJournal.tsx` and `CNN` label from `BusinessSkills.tsx`; keep other numbering systems, array order, content, links, accessible labels, and stable test identifiers unchanged.
- [x] Replace the dark Business `--text-300` muted taupe with a palette-derived near-cream value while keeping light-mode text tokens unchanged and preserving visual hierarchy through size, weight, and existing accent roles.
- [x] Run focused Business/accessibility tests, the complete Vitest suite, ESLint, TypeScript/Vite build, Prettier, contrast verification, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] Update the code-generation summary, plan checkboxes, state, and append-only audit immediately after the amendment is implemented.
- **Traceability**: BYC-11 through BYC-13, BYC-NFR-01 through BYC-NFR-05, and acceptance criteria 10 through 12.

### Step 10 - Remove All Decorative Numbering and Wire Supplied Project Images

- [x] Add focused regression assertions that reject Business chapter/showcase/case labels, navigation counters, standalone sequence indexes, and prefixed award/outcome codes while preserving meaningful dates, years, metric values, and stable test identifiers.
- [x] Remove decorative numbering from `BusinessHero.tsx`, `BusinessShell.tsx`, `BusinessSectionHeading.tsx`, `BusinessAbout.tsx`, `BusinessEducation.tsx`, `BusinessExperience.tsx`, `BusinessAwards.tsx`, `BusinessProjects.tsx`, `BusinessGallery.tsx`, `BusinessJournal.tsx`, `BusinessSkills.tsx`, and `BusinessDetailList.tsx`.
- [x] Simplify affected Chakra grid definitions and `business.css` grid columns/classes so no empty counter column or orphaned counter style remains; keep content order, responsive behavior, links, headings, and semantic list structure unchanged.
- [x] Update `src/data/projects.ts` to import `coursework_and_certificates.png`, `program_analyzer.png`, and `java_resume_application.png`, and revise each `imageAlt` to match the supplied screenshot or diagram.
- [x] Validate the three supplied PNG assets and their project mapping; do not generate, transform, or overwrite the user-provided image files.
- [x] Run focused Business/data tests, the complete Vitest suite, ESLint, TypeScript/Vite production build, Prettier, decorative-number/source scans, asset-resolution checks, scoped diff inspection, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] Update the requirements status, code-generation summary, plan checkboxes, state, and append-only audit immediately after the amendment is implemented.
- **Traceability**: BYC-14, BYC-15, BYC-06, BYC-NFR-03 through BYC-NFR-05, and acceptance criteria 13 and 14.

### Step 11 - Left-Align Project Images and Pad Left Navigation

- [x] Add focused regression assertions that `.business-case-image` uses `object-position: left center` while retaining `object-fit: cover`, and that every Business navigation link receives consistent horizontal padding.
- [x] Add only the scoped left-center object-position rule for Business project images; keep source assets, aspect ratios, frame dimensions, project data, alternative text, and responsive visibility unchanged.
- [x] Replace the Business navigation link's conditional zero-padding rule with consistent `px={3}` spacing for both left-rail and mobile links so active-state text never touches the border or shifts.
- [x] Record and compare SHA-256 hashes for all three PNG files before and after the CSS change to prove that no image was cropped, transformed, or overwritten.
- [x] Run focused Business/accessibility tests, the complete Vitest suite, ESLint, TypeScript/Vite production build, Prettier, scoped diff inspection, asset-integrity checks, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] Update the requirements status, code-generation summary, plan checkboxes, state, and append-only audit immediately after the amendment is implemented.
- **Traceability**: BYC-16, BYC-17, BYC-06, BYC-NFR-03 through BYC-NFR-05, and acceptance criteria 15 and 16.

### Step 12 - Center Contact Email and Reduce Profile Record

- [x] Add focused regression assertions requiring the bordered contact email to use `align-self: center` and the Business profile record to use responsive centered sizing.
- [x] Replace only the contact email's `align-self: flex-start` declaration with `align-self: center`; retain its width, maximum width, border, padding, font size, wrapping, address, link behavior, and the alignment of all neighboring content.
- [x] Add scoped `.business-subject-record` declarations for `width: 100%`, `max-width: 24rem`, and `justify-self: center`; retain the portrait's aspect ratio, cover crop, source asset, metadata rows, and responsive readability.
- [x] Record and compare the profile JPEG's SHA-256 hash before and after implementation to prove the source portrait remains unchanged.
- [x] Run focused Business/accessibility tests, the complete Vitest suite, ESLint, TypeScript/Vite production build, Prettier, responsive-rule inspection, asset-integrity checks, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] Update the requirements status, code-generation summary, plan checkboxes, state, and append-only audit immediately after the amendment is implemented.
- **Traceability**: BYC-18, BYC-19, BYC-06, BYC-NFR-03 through BYC-NFR-05, and acceptance criteria 17 and 18.

### Step 13 - Correct Contact Optical Centering and Portrait Scale

- [x] Add focused regression assertions requiring centered alignment for the complete Direct Contact card and social row, plus a `20rem` profile-record cap and `4 / 3` portrait frame.
- [x] Add `align-items: center` and `text-align: center` to `.business-contact-card`, and `justify-content: center` to `.business-contact-socials`, while preserving spacing, wrapping, content order, and link behavior.
- [x] Reduce `.business-subject-record` from `24rem` to `20rem` and change the Business portrait's displayed aspect ratio from `4 / 4.4` to `4 / 3`; retain `width: 100%`, centered grid alignment, cover behavior, source asset, and metadata.
- [x] Record and compare the profile JPEG's SHA-256 hash before and after implementation to prove that only its presentation changes.
- [x] Run focused Business/accessibility tests, the complete Vitest suite, ESLint, TypeScript/Vite production build, Prettier, scoped responsive-rule inspection, asset-integrity checks, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] Update the requirements status, code-generation summary, plan checkboxes, state, and append-only audit immediately after the correction is implemented.
- **Traceability**: BYC-20, BYC-21, BYC-06, BYC-NFR-03 through BYC-NFR-05, and acceptance criteria 19 and 20.

### Step 14 - Lengthen Portrait and Highlight Contact Actions

- [x] Add focused regression assertions requiring the `4 / 3.5` portrait frame and highlighted background, border, padding, and hover declarations for both the email and social links.
- [x] Change only the Business portrait's displayed aspect ratio from `4 / 3` to `4 / 3.5`; retain the `20rem` record cap, centered alignment, cover behavior, source asset, alternative text, and metadata.
- [x] Add `var(--control-bg-soft)` backgrounds to the existing email box and each social link, style social links as individually padded bordered controls, and add `var(--control-hover-bg)` hover feedback while retaining wrapping, destinations, accessible names, and focus styles.
- [x] Record and compare the profile JPEG's SHA-256 hash before and after implementation to prove that only its presentation changes.
- [x] Run focused Business/accessibility tests, the complete Vitest suite, ESLint, TypeScript/Vite production build, Prettier, scoped style inspection, asset-integrity checks, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] Update the requirements status, code-generation summary, plan checkboxes, state, and append-only audit immediately after the amendment is implemented.
- **Traceability**: BYC-22, BYC-23, BYC-06, BYC-NFR-01 through BYC-NFR-05, and acceptance criteria 21 and 22.
