# Requirements - Business Youthful Color Refresh

> **Status: Approved through BYC-23, including the portrait-length and contact-highlight amendment approved on 2026-08-27.** Generated from the supplied Color Hunt palettes, screenshot reviews, supplied project assets, and the existing Business presentation boundary.

## Intent Analysis

- **User request**: Replace the Business theme's brown and beige color system with the supplied blue, teal, mint, and cream palette so it feels more youthful, modern, and sleek like Engineering.
- **Request type**: User-facing visual enhancement.
- **Scope estimate**: One isolated theme stylesheet plus focused theme-accessibility verification and workflow documentation.
- **Complexity**: Simple; the Business theme already centralizes its palette through scoped CSS variables.
- **Requirements depth**: Minimal.

## Approved Design Input

| Role       | Source color | Intended use                                                             |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Deep blue  | `#3368A0`    | Primary accents, readable labels, actions, and structural emphasis       |
| Sky blue   | `#66A3BF`    | Secondary accents, borders, glows, and interactive highlights            |
| Pale mint  | `#C8DFDB`    | Light surfaces, soft panels, decorative depth, and supporting highlights |
| Warm cream | `#F2EFE7`    | Light canvas, dark-mode text, and calm reading surfaces                  |

Derived tints, shades, transparencies, and color mixes may be used when necessary for dark-mode depth, surface hierarchy, hover states, and WCAG contrast. The four supplied colors remain the visible palette foundation.

### Approved Text Palette Amendment

| Text role   | Source color | Intended use                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dark text   | `#524646`    | Light-mode primary text and readable button text on pale surfaces           |
| Muted text  | `#A8A492`    | Dark-mode supporting copy and the source for accessible light-mode variants |
| Cream text  | `#FCF2E5`    | Dark-mode primary text and text on blue actions                             |
| Orange text | `#EC5B38`    | Dark-mode display accents and the source for accessible small-text variants |

The previously approved blue, mint, and cream palette remains authoritative for backgrounds, surfaces, borders, controls, glows, and other non-text roles. Accessible derived gray and orange variants may replace the exact source color for small text when the exact value does not reach 4.5:1.

## Functional Requirements

| ID     | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BYC-01 | Replace the current brown, bronze, beige, and warm-ink Business palette with the supplied four-color palette and derived accessible variants.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| BYC-02 | Refresh the complete Business light and dark systems, including canvas backgrounds, architectural grid, glows, surfaces, borders, controls, selected navigation, labels, links, buttons, forms, media shells, modal overlay, focus states, and Direct Contact panel.                                                                          |
| BYC-03 | Light mode must use cream and pale mint as the calm foundation, with deep blue for readable text and primary emphasis and sky blue for supporting color.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| BYC-04 | Dark mode must use deep derived blue surfaces with cream text, blue and mint highlights, and sufficient layer separation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| BYC-05 | Business must feel youthful, modern, and sleek through cleaner cool-color contrast and luminous background depth while retaining its existing editorial casebook identity.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| BYC-06 | Business layout, section composition, typography, content, spacing, routes, interactions, certificate previews, and responsive behavior must remain unchanged except where a color declaration requires adjustment.                                                                                                                           |
| BYC-07 | Engineering source and presentation must remain unchanged while the retired third-theme implementation, registry entry, option metadata, persisted-ID support, and dedicated tests are removed completely.                                                                                                                                    |
| BYC-08 | The visible theme selector and runtime registry must expose exactly Engineering and Business; obsolete saved theme values must fall back to Engineering.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| BYC-09 | Business primary, secondary, accent, and action text must use the supplied `#524646`, `#A8A492`, `#FCF2E5`, and `#EC5B38` text palette or accessible derived variants, without replacing the approved background palette.                                                                                                                     |
| BYC-10 | Current source, public documentation, and active/non-audit workflow documentation must not mention or retain the removed third theme. The append-only audit remains immutable as required by repository governance.                                                                                                                           |
| BYC-11 | The Business Direct Contact email must use a smaller responsive size, remain fully visible without clipping, and sit inside a clear palette-aligned border with sufficient internal spacing.                                                                                                                                                  |
| BYC-12 | Remove the decorative `Film NN` labels from Business video cards and the `CNN` labels from Business certificate cards while preserving card order, content, links, and stable test identifiers.                                                                                                                                               |
| BYC-13 | Increase the brightness of dark-mode supporting text toward the approved cream text color so body copy and metadata are easier to read while retaining accessible hierarchy and at least 4.5:1 contrast.                                                                                                                                      |
| BYC-14 | Remove every decorative sequence number from the Business presentation, including chapter/showcase/case markers, navigation counters, standalone list indexes, gallery/writing/skill counters, and prefixed award/outcome codes. Preserve meaningful dates, years, metric values, technical quantities, content, and stable test identifiers. |
| BYC-15 | Replace the three deleted WebP project-cover references with the supplied PNG files in `src/assets/projects`, map each image to its matching project, and update alternative text to describe the actual screenshot or architecture diagram. No generated image is required.                                                                  |
| BYC-16 | Keep all three supplied project PNG files unchanged and left-align their displayed `object-fit: cover` crop so the left side remains visible in the narrow Business project-image frame instead of using centered cropping.                                                                                                                   |
| BYC-17 | Add consistent horizontal padding to every Business left-rail navigation row so selected and unselected labels have clear separation from the active border and do not shift when selection changes.                                                                                                                                          |
| BYC-18 | Center the bordered Direct Contact email link horizontally within its contact card while preserving its responsive size, complete address, padding, border, wrapping, link behavior, and surrounding content alignment.                                                                                                                       |
| BYC-19 | Apply the initial displayed Business profile-record reduction with responsive centered sizing and an initial `24rem` cap, while keeping the source profile image, crop, metadata, and narrow-screen fit unchanged. BYC-21 supersedes the initial cap and frame ratio.                                                                         |
| BYC-20 | Center the complete Direct Contact card content horizontally, including its label, bordered email, location, and social links, so the composition is visually centered rather than centering only the email link.                                                                                                                             |
| BYC-21 | Make the Business portrait visibly smaller by reducing the centered profile record to a `20rem` maximum width and initially changing the displayed portrait frame from the tall `4 / 4.4` ratio to `4 / 3`, while preserving the source image, cover behavior, metadata, and narrow-screen fit. BYC-22 supersedes the final frame ratio.      |
| BYC-22 | Retain the centered `20rem` profile-record cap but lengthen the displayed portrait frame slightly from `4 / 3` to `4 / 3.5`, showing more of the source portrait without returning to the original oversized presentation or changing the image file.                                                                                         |
| BYC-23 | Add palette-aligned background highlights, borders, and internal spacing to the bordered contact email and each of the three social links, plus a visible hover response, while preserving centered alignment, wrapping, destinations, accessible names, and focus visibility.                                                                |

## Non-Functional Requirements

| ID         | Requirement                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BYC-NFR-01 | Business normal text must meet at least 4.5:1 contrast; large text and essential control boundaries must meet at least 3:1 in both modes.   |
| BYC-NFR-02 | Decorative grid and glow layers must not reduce readability, focus visibility, or media clarity.                                            |
| BYC-NFR-03 | All Business color rules must remain scoped under `.portfolio-template-business` or its owned overlays and must not leak into other themes. |
| BYC-NFR-04 | No new runtime dependency, asset download, component architecture, route, data model, or infrastructure change may be introduced.           |
| BYC-NFR-05 | Existing reduced-motion, keyboard, responsive, and static GitHub Pages behavior must remain valid.                                          |

## Acceptance Criteria

1. No active Business token retains the old brown, bronze, beige, or warm-ink palette values.
2. The supplied blue, sky-blue, mint, and cream colors are visibly represented throughout Business light and dark modes.
3. Background, surfaces, navigation, controls, labels, forms, contact content, focus states, and certificate presentation form one coherent cool-color system.
4. Automated contrast checks pass for representative Business text, accent, primary button, and hover pairs.
5. Focused Business and accessibility tests, the complete Vitest suite, ESLint, TypeScript/Vite build, Prettier, stale-color scan, and `git diff --check` pass.
6. Representative Business light and dark views retain readable content, distinct surfaces, visible focus, stable layouts, and the original editorial composition.
7. Engineering and shared content remain unchanged; the registry, selector, and persisted selection behavior support exactly Engineering and Business.
8. Business text visibly follows the supplied dark-taupe, muted-taupe, cream, and orange palette while normal-sized text retains at least 4.5:1 contrast.
9. The removed theme has no source directory, import, type member, option, registry entry, valid persisted ID, dedicated test, or non-audit documentation reference.
10. The Direct Contact email remains fully readable at desktop and narrow responsive widths and has a visible border, padding, and focus treatment.
11. Business video and certificate cards render without the decorative `Film NN` and `CNN` labels; their existing content and links remain intact.
12. Dark-mode primary and supporting text use cream or near-cream palette values and meet the existing contrast thresholds against their assigned surfaces.
13. No decorative Business sequence marker remains in rendered content or orphaned presentation styles; layouts close the space formerly reserved for counters without changing semantic content.
14. All three project entries resolve to their supplied PNG replacements, their alternative text matches the visible subject, and the production build contains no missing project-image import.
15. Every Business project image uses a left-center object position at all responsive sizes, retains cover behavior and frame dimensions, and the source PNG files remain byte-for-byte unchanged.
16. Every left-rail Business navigation link has consistent horizontal padding in active and inactive states, with unchanged navigation behavior, focus visibility, row height, and mobile-drawer spacing.
17. The bordered Direct Contact email link is horizontally centered within its card at desktop and narrow responsive widths without clipping or changing link behavior.
18. The Business profile record retains `width: 100%` and centered grid alignment; its final maximum width and portrait ratio follow criterion 20, the portrait source remains byte-for-byte unchanged, and the metadata stays readable at narrow widths.
19. The Direct Contact label, email box, location, and social links share centered horizontal alignment, while the social links retain their wrapping and interaction behavior.
20. The Business profile record has a `20rem` maximum width and a compact cover frame whose final ratio follows criterion 21; the source JPEG remains byte-for-byte unchanged and metadata remains readable on narrow screens.
21. The final Business portrait presentation retains the `20rem` record cap and uses a `4 / 3.5` cover frame, revealing more vertical image content while the source JPEG remains byte-for-byte unchanged.
22. The contact email and all three social links use coherent palette-aligned highlighted surfaces, borders, padding, hover feedback, and existing focus treatment without changing their labels or destinations.
